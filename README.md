# LamaPrivateMode
A script that allows you to restrict access to the server (e.g. for beta testers, dev mode...)

I know txAdmin offers a function to restrict access. Nevertheless, this script can be useful if you don't want to give every beta tester or dev admin rights.

When the script is started, only players who are entered in the config can connect. If a player connects who is not in the list, he will be kicked immediately.
